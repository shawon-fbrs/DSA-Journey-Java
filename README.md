# üöÄ Java DSA Mastery Repository üöÄ


## Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

#### Welcome to my dedicated space for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. This repository isn't just a collection of solutions; it's a testament to consistent effort and attention to detail.

## üí° The Core Philosophy
This project is guided by three principles, ensuring continuous learning and high-quality code:


```
public class MyCommitment {

    /**
     * EVERYDAY UPDATES
     * Consistency is key. New concepts, problem sets, or code reviews 
     * are pushed daily to maintain momentum and track daily progress.
     */
    private final boolean dailyCommit = true;

    /**
     * EVERY QUESTION TOUCHED
     * No problem is left unsolved. I ensure a complete and efficient solution 
     * is implemented for every concept introduced.
     */
    private final String problemStatus = "SOLVED_AND_OPTIMIZED";

    /**
     * EVERY SEMICOLON TRAVERSED
     * A focus on clean, precise code syntax and logic, ensuring every line 
     * executes perfectly‚Äîdown to the last ';'.
     */
    public boolean syntaxIsPerfect(int errors) {
        return errors == 0;
    }
    
    // Status check:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (dailyCommit && problemStatus.equals("SOLVED_AND_OPTIMIZED") && new MyCommitment().syntaxIsPerfect(0)) {
            System.out.println("Status: **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - Learning in Progress.");
        }
    }
}


```

## üìÇ Repository Structure
My solutions are organized into clear, intuitive folders to help track progress:
| Directory   | Focus   | Status   | Key Concepts|
| :---  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01_Conditional_Statements` | Basic Syntax and Control Flow | ‚úÖ In Progress | Conditionals (if/else, switch)|
| `02_Loops` | Basic Syntax of loops  | ‚úÖ In Progress | Loops (for, while)|
| `03_Patterns` | Using loops for geometric patterns  | ‚úÖ In Progress | Nested loops, logic for pattern generation |
| `04_Functions` | Function & Methods  | ‚úÖ In Progress | Function Calling, Function Overloading |
